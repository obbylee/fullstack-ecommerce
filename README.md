# fs-ecommerce

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, React Router, Hono, TRPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **React Router** - Declarative routing for React
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **tRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs
- **Bun** - Runtime environment
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to see the web application.

The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
